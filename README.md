The app is similar to a messaging service. Initially, user needs to login so
that the app can save user's name. Once user is taken to the main page after
entering his/her name on the auth page, user can enter the name of another
contact/user he/she wants to send message. The contact may not exist at the time
of sending the message. But when someone enters the app with that contact/user
name, he/she can see messages sent to that name. A contact/user can send message
to oneself.
