# Message app

[Live demo]()

![Main page](/client/src/assets/main-page.png "Main page")

The app is similar to a messaging service. Initially, you need to login so that
the app can save your name. Once you taken to the main page after entering your
name on the auth page, you can input the name of the so-called contact you want
send a message to. The contact may not exist at the time of sending message. But
when someone enters the app with that contact name, he/she can see messages sent
to his/her name. A contact/user can send message to oneself. First, messages
were saved inside [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas) but since
this app was created for practicing, messages are now saved as Markdown
documents (.md files)
