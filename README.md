The app is similar to a messaging service. Initially, user needs to login so
that the app can save user's name in the database. Once user is taken to the
main page after entering his/her name on the auth page, user can enter the name
of another contact/user he wants to send message. The contact may not exist at
the time of sending the message. But when someone enters the app with that
contact/user name, he can see messages sent to that name. A contact/user can
send message to oneself.
